# DriveNow Cost Calculator

This project is a very simple, quick and dirty DriveNow cost calculator.  

[Try it out here.](https://www.rm-it.de/drivenow-calculator/index.html)

It is a early alpha version!  
Always double check the result!

The price structure of DriveNow is rather hard to correctly calculate in your head, so this project tries to help out with that.

It tries to give an answer to the question "does it make sense to buy an hourly package or is the standard rate better for the trip I'm planning?"

The prices are calculated as to my best understanding of the price structure.  
It does not consider the "Savings Packages" as those are reoccurring fees that can only booked once per month.  

If you found an error please contact me or create an issue on GitHub.  
No guarantees are given on the displayed prices!  
Always double check the prices before booking.
